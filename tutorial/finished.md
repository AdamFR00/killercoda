## Congratulations ðŸŽˆ

Congratulations on completing this tutorial! You've successfully set up a container observability stack, including:

- **cAdvisor** collecting detailed container metrics.

- **Prometheus** scraping and storing those metrics.

- **Grafana** visualizing the data in real-time dashboards.

- A **Flask application** that you could stress test to see immediate impacts on CPU and memory usage.
