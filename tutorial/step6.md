## Step 6: Observing CPU Load in Grafana

### Observe Current CPU Usage

1. Make sure your Grafana dashboard is open and showing the **"CPU Usage"** (or whatever you decided to name it) panel.

2. You should see a baseline level of CPU usage for your `flask-app` container.

### Trigger the CPU Stress Test

1. Open a new tab in your browser.

2. Visit the CPU stress endpoint for your Flask app: **[http://localhost:5000/cpu-stress]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_5000}}/cpu-stress)**

3. This endpoint will run calculations within the `flask-app` container for a set duration (approximately 20 seconds).

### Witness the Impact on Grafana

1. Switch back to your Grafana tab.

2. You will likely see the graph automatically update. If not, you can manually refresh it or adjust the time range selector at the top to **"Last 5 minutes"** or **"Last 1 minute"** to zoom into the current activity.

3. You should see a spike in CPU usage, reflecting the load generated by the `/cpu-stress` endpoint.
